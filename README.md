# Tic-Tac-Toe game for WDI Week 3

I made this app while learning about JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, and CSS. I used Bootstrap for the layout of the page. I wrote the game functionality entirely in vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. 

The JS can be refactored to use localStorage, and much of the click listeners can be refactored by listening for a click on something with a "square" class (i.e. any square) rather than on individual squares. The particular one clicked on can be retrieved by getting that square's attributes with the 'this' keyword.
